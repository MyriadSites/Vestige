<title>About Vestige 25</title>

<body class="aboutBody">
	<a class="aboutHeader">About</a><br>
	<div class="aboutText">Vestige 25 was developed by Mitchell Taylor in late 2024. Initially released on 1 January 2025, it is a revamped version of Countdown to Summer, which was initially released on the 28th of February 2023.<br>
The first complete issue of Countdown to Summer was published a few weeks later on the 24th of March, receiving only minor updates before being taken down at the end of the following school year on the 10th of June 2024.<br>
Maintenance of Countdown to Summer ceased on the 11th of January 2024 when Countdown to Summer 3 entered development. The project, however, would soon be cancelled with minimal progress having been made.<br>
Development on Vestige 25 began on the 23rd of September later that year, being built from the ground up in HTML in order to avoid any of the issues which plagued former versions.<br>
Several themes will soon be added to Vestige 25, including multiple colour themes, holiday themes, and the classic 'retrowave' theme.</div>
